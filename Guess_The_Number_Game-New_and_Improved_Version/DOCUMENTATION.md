- The new and improved version of Guess The Number Game, built in a way that is menu-driven and more engaging to play.
- 
- The computer generates a random number out of a given range of whole numbers (0 to n) where n is the upper limit and it is user entered.
- 
- The user is given attempts equal to 12% of the upper limit of the range.
- 
- If the user is not able to make a correct guess, the loop is run until the number of attempts is exhausted and a message citing "YOU LOST" and what the correct number, but if he guesses the number correctly, the program ends with a message citing "YOU WON".
- 
- The user has to make a BLIND GUESS by default, but the user can also take the help of a HINT, which tells whether the number he/she entered is less than or greater than the number generated by the computer.
- 
- Taking the HINT eats up one more attempts of the user, at a time.
- 
- So, taking a HINT eats up 2 attempts in total, whereas, a BLIND GUESS eats up one attempt.
- 
- If the user correctly guesses the number, then he/she is also congratulated on guessing the correct number in just n number of attempts, using only n number of hints or without using any hint at all.
- 
- So, guess wisely and have fun.
